# zig init

Initializes a `zig build` project in the current working directory.

1. **Project Structure Creation**:

    The command creates a new directory structure for your project if it doesn't already exist. This structure includes directories for your source code, dependencies, and other project-related files.

2. **Configuration Files**:

    It generates configuration files necessary for the `zig build` system. These files contain settings and instructions on how to build your project. The main file created is `build.zig`, which is a Zig script that the `zig build` system uses to compile your project.

3. **Initial Source File**:

    Often, a simple "Hello, World!" source file is created as part of the initialization process. This serves as a starting point for your project's development.

4. **Git Repository (Optional)**:

    Depending on the version of Zig and the options you specify, `zig init` might also initialize a Git repository in your project directory. This is useful for version control and is a common practice in software development.
